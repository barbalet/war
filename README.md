## DESCRIPTION

There is no such thing as noble warfare. This development is not designed to glorify war, nor is it designed to provide graphic realism in the reality of war. Noble Warfare can be thought of more like a chess-like war game simulation. Where combatants are pieces rather than people.

Since the mid-1990s, the source code of the Noble Ape Simulation has moved to a level of maturity. It was time for guerrilla simulation. There was an article in Develop magazine about the BBC television program, Time Commanders:

The article noted the proprietary development created the climate for the development of the television program.

This threw the gauntlet down to open source development which appeared to have been very poor in creating coherent non-turn based strategy games.

Noble Warfare is a game engine. While an example battle is provided with the software, you are free to create your own battles and armies that are compatible with Noble Warfare. You are free to create websites, resources, file editing tools or even your own versions of Noble Warfare with your own house rules.

There were two primary reasons for the Noble Warfare development.

(1) The Noble Ape development created a lot of great stuff that was overlooked because of the Noble Ape Simulation's niche appeal. Creating a more mainstream development like Noble Warfare allowed more people to use and enjoy the Noble Ape development.

(2) The Noble Warfare primary developer, Tom Barbalet, is an active member of the International Game Developers' Association. This membership was based on Barbalet's earlier work. Barbalet wanted to see how well the Open Source philosophy would translate to a more traditional game development. To this end, the Noble Warfare development is an active experiment.
